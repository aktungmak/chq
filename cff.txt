Config file format

The config file is comprised of two types of declaration - nodes and connections. There is also a comment type.

It makes sense to put the declarations first and the connections second, but this is not mandatory.

Parsing of the file is line-based - items cannot extend beyond one line.

Type 1: Node declaration
